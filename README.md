# Software-development-for-algorithmic-problems

3 Part project for the course Software-development-for-algorithmic-problems(K23Î³), UoA

Impementation of K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithms LSH and Hypercube 

[Part 1](https://github.com/ArisChar/Software-development-for-algorithmic-problems/blob/main/Project/ergasia1_2021.pdf): 
  Vector search and clustering:
    given dataset of vectors find for everyone the true nearest neighbor, N aproximate nearest neighbors and all vectors in range tha is given.
      
[Part 2](https://github.com/ArisChar/Software-development-for-algorithmic-problems/blob/main/Project_2/ergasia2_2021.pdf): 
  Hashing and searching for time series:
    we compare the time series using Discrete Frechet and Continuous Frechet metric.    

[Part 3](https://github.com/ArisChar/Software-development-for-algorithmic-problems/blob/main/project_3/ergasia3_2021.pdf): 
  Stock price forecasting using LSTM recurrent neural network.  
  Anomaly detection using a per-stock LSTM autoencoding neural network.  
  Stock search and clustering based on time series representation derived from convolutional autoencoding.  
  Comparison of search and clustering results with the original representation.  
  Python 3 and the Keras programming interface on the TensorFlow neural network platform was used to implement the neural network.
